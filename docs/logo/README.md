# Logo Files

Place your logo files here:

- `light.png` - Logo for light mode (recommended: 120x30px)
- `dark.png` - Logo for dark mode (recommended: 120x30px)
- `../favicon.png` - Favicon (recommended: 32x32px)

## Creating Logos

You can create logos using:
1. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) - Free design tool
2. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Professional design
3. [LogoMakr](https://logomakr.com/) - Quick logo maker
4. Text-based logo using your project name

## Temporary Solution

```json
{
  "name": "create-llm"
  // Remove logo section temporarily
}
```
